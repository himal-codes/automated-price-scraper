# 🤖 Automated Price Scraper & Login Bot

### 🚀 Overview
This tool automates the process of logging into secure websites (handling authentication) and extracting business-critical data into Excel-ready formats. 

Unlike simple scrapers, this bot is designed to:
1.  **Bypass Authentication:** Automatically inputs credentials and navigates security gates.
2.  **Batch Process Data:** Scrapes multiple product lines simultaneously.
3.  **Generate Reports:** Exports raw data directly to CSV for analysis.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **Selenium WebDriver** (Browser Automation)
* **CSV Module** (Data Formatting)

### 📂 Files in this Repo
* `login_bot.py`: The main automation engine.
* `sauce_data.csv`: Sample output generated by the bot (Proof of Work).

### ⚡ How It Works
1.  The bot launches a "Ghost Browser" (Chrome).
2.  It navigates to the target portal (`saucedemo.com`).
3.  It performs a secure login using injected credentials.
4.  It scrapes Product Names and Real-time Prices.
5.  It saves the data cleanly to `sauce_data.csv`.

### 🔮 Future Improvements
* Adding "Headless Mode" to run on servers without a screen.
* Email automation to send the CSV report to managers daily.
